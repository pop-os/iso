# Contributing to Pop\!\_OS

Welcome to the Pop\!\_OS repository, we hope you are enjoying getting a look at the code! If you're considering contributing to the project, please take a look at the instructions for how to contribute before submitting any feature requests, bugs to the issue tracker, or code.

## How to Contribute

### Using the Issue Tracker

If you are considering filing a feature request, bug, or asking a question - please bear in mind that we have a different process than many projects for doing each of those tasks. A bug, with a description, can be filed in the issue tracker. If you are detailing something that Pop\!\_OS is doing that it shouldn't, that represents a flaw in the execution of a task the operating system is supposed to perform - please detail it in the issue tracker. Filing bugs represents the proper use of the issue tracker for most contributors (besides maintainers).

General questions, feedback, and discussion topics **should not** be submitted to as an issue in the issue tracker. These should be posted on the [Pop\!\_OS Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/pop_os), which represents the official community forum. It is there that ideas can be discussed, questions answered, and feedback reviewed. These things will actively be removed from the Issue Tracker if posted.

Feature requests follow our contribution process. In order to understand how features get selected to be implemented into Pop\!\_OS, please read our [Development Approach doc](https://support.system76.com/articles/pop-os-development-approach). But anything that exists outside of what we may discover via Research & Modeling will travel through the following contribution process:

* Idea and Brainstorming = [Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/pop_os)
* Under Consideration = [Pop\!\_Docs](https://support.system76.com)
* Approved and on Roadmap = ["On Roadmap" in Issue Tracker](https://github.com/system76/pop-distro/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22On+Roadmap%22)
